You have contacted Comm100 Technical Support team. What do you need help with? \n[2022/04/26 17:48:58]:Theo Theodoridis:Hello there! I have comm100 at my wp site. The issue that I'm facing is the following. At the website, there is google recpatcha. When recaptcha ask the user to confirm something (ie. find the images that contain boats etc.) the comm100 chat button is at the same point on the screen where the recaptcha\n[2022/04/26 17:49:24]:Theo Theodoridis:confirmation button is. As a result, user cannot push the recaptcha's button.\n[2022/04/26 17:49:57]:Theo Theodoridis:this all is happening at a call to action button and mostly at the mobile layout.\n[2022/04/26 17:50:08]:Walid - Comm100:In the chat button settings you have the option to change the offset values\n[2022/04/26 17:51:29]:Theo Theodoridis:Yes I know. But the position is right. Otherwise there are other issues. Can we do something in order to let recaptcha appear before comm100 live chat btn?\n[2022/04/26 17:52:05]:Walid - Comm100:The reCaptcha is not controlled by comm100 is it? \n[2022/04/26 17:52:16]:Theo Theodoridis:no actually\n[2022/04/26 17:53:11]:Walid - Comm100:So when it appears is not determined by us. I believe your front end developer can write something to control when it appears \n[2022/04/26 17:53:29]:Walid - Comm100:But we don't have anything to control that unfortunately \n[2022/04/26 17:54:21]:Theo Theodoridis:the comm100 is installed via plugin. So where can the FE dev write? should we install it via js or something?\n[2022/04/26 17:55:45]:Walid - Comm100:I am not sure how the reCaptcha loads and how it's controlled. Isnt it something your team has implemented ?  \n[2022/04/26 17:56:37]:Walid - Comm100:and since it's not a comm100 thing we cannot tell  how it works and how to modify it unfortunately \n[2022/04/26 17:56:51]:Theo Theodoridis:these are wordrpress plugins.

How may I help you?\n[2022/04/19 21:49:39]:Alex Draina:Hello Lucas. We have recently been updated to the new web portal and desktop client. Since then, querying tickets and messaging does not seem to function properly.\n[2022/04/19 21:50:22]:Alex Draina:For example, searching by subject or by recipient email address does not yield the expected results within the desktop client. The web portal seems to be okay.\n[2022/04/19 21:51:19]:Lucas - Comm100:Did you search by entire email address?\n[2022/04/19 21:57:25]:Alex Draina:yes\n[2022/04/19 21:59:12]:Lucas - Comm100:Understood.

For example, when you do the search by \"\"adraina@bestcigarprices.com\"\", it's splitted into adraina, bestcigarprices and com. As long as any section includes the word, it returns. You can search by \"\"bestcigarprices\"\".\n[2022/04/19 22:03:46]:Alex :okay but that is the issue, as you can see from my screenshot. It does not return.\n[2022/04/19 22:04:30]:Alex :searching \"\"adraina\"\" no results. telling me to search \"\"bestcigarprices\"\" is like saying search for \"\"gmail\"\". There will be a ton of unnecessary results.\n[2022/04/19 22:05:01]:Alex :in fact, searching \"\"best cigar prices\"\" leads to an internal server error, probably due to the amount of times our company is mentioned in tickets. \n[2022/04/19 22:05:13]:Alex :sorry, meant \"\"bestcigarprices\"\"\n[2022/04/19 22:05:35]:Alex :point is, it worked fine before the update. now it does not. \n[2022/04/19 22:05:54]:Alex :the only query I can get to yield valid results is the @mention of an agent\n[2022/04/19 22:07:17]:Lucas - Comm100:As I do not have your login credential, my test result is as below\nAgent Lucas - Comm100 has sent a file: 1650377244661.png\n[2022/04/19 22:07:45]:Lucas - Comm100:The email address is kathrinea@xxx.com\n[2022/04/19 22:08:01]:Alex :okay lets forget email for a second.\nThe visitor has sent a file: Screen Shot 2022-04-19 at 10.08.06 AM.png\n[2022/04/19 22:08:23]:Alex :see subject \"\"Back order on order: #2502397\"\"\n[2022/04/19 22:08:34]:Lucas - Comm100:We have escalated to tech team for the exact search.

How can we do that?\n[2024/05/25 01:12:18]:Viki - Comm100:For the de-active, do you want to hide the chat button on that page?\n[2024/05/25 01:13:42]:Kamran :Yes. That's correct. \n[2024/05/25 01:15:06]:Viki - Comm100:You can choose to display your chat button on certain pages, the chat button will only be visible under certain pages.\nAgent Viki - Comm100 has sent a file: 2024-05-24T17-15-05-701Z.png\n[2024/05/25 01:15:07]:Viki - Comm100:If you want to de-active the chat on certain pages, you will just need to remove the URL from the list.\n[2024/05/25 01:16:54]:Kamran :How can we make it go away from all the pages?\n[2024/05/25 01:17:03]:Kamran :We don't want it on any pages.\n[2024/05/25 01:17:17]:Viki - Comm100:You can remove the installation code from the page\n[2024/05/25 01:17:28]:Kamran :We can't do that.\n[2024/05/25 01:17:42]:Kamran :We don't have access to installation and back end of our customers.\n[2024/05/25 01:18:22]:Viki - Comm100:Or you can choose to hide the chat button while agents offline, as long as agent s are all offline , the chat button will be invisible\nAgent Viki - Comm100 has sent a file: 2024-05-24T17-18-21-933Z.png\n[2024/05/25 01:19:01]:Kamran :WE can't do that either because our team of 20 agents are 24/7.\n[2024/05/25 01:19:42]:Kamran :What if we just put an unrelated URL under Advanced?\n[2024/05/25 01:20:08]:Viki - Comm100:Okay, so for those websites, do they have separate campaigns?\n[2024/05/25 01:20:29]:Kamran :Yes, we are running about 500 different campaigns.\n[2024/05/25 01:21:54]:Viki - Comm100:Okay for this case, you will need to create an empty department without any agents. Then select the campaign that belongs to that website, and set the routing rule like this. To route all the chats to that empty department:\nAgent Viki - Comm100 has sent a file: 2024-05-24T17-21-54-147Z.png\n[2024/05/25 01:22:23]:Viki - Comm100:Then enable this Hide chat button while team is offline\nAgent Viki - Comm100 has sent a file: 2024-05-24T17-22-22-858Z.png\n[2024/05/25 01:23:06]:Kamran :Got it. We have been experimenting with this idea.\n[2024/05/25 01:23:18]:Kamran :We were hoping that there would be an easier solution. \n[2024/05/25 01:23:42]:Viki - Comm100:Since this campaign's chats will be routed to the empty department, so the routed department will also be offline, and the chat button will be hidden all the time.\n[2024/05/25 01:23:49]:Kamran :What about the idea of an unrelated URL underAdvanced settings?\n[2024/05/25 01:24:34]:Viki - Comm100:You can try that as well, just put a general URL like Google, or https://www.comm100.com/\n[2024/05/25 01:25:03]:Kamran :Exactly. Let me try that. That seems to be easier than the routing option.\n[2024/05/25 01:25:11]:Viki - Comm100:As long as the page doesn't have your installation code, the chat button won't display under that or other pages\n[2024/05/25 01:26:00]:Kamran :I will just use www.google.com. And that's campaign specific. Right?\n[2024/05/25 01:26:26]:Viki - Comm100:Yes, so please ensure you are editing under the right campaign\n[2024/05/25 01:27:27]:Kamran :Got it.\ud83d\udc4d\n[2024/05/25 01:28:12]:Kamran :Thanks for your help.\n[2024/05/25 01:28:27]:Viki - Comm100:No problem at all!\n[2024/05/25 01:28:34]:Viki - Comm100:Anything else I can help you today?\nAgent Viki - Comm100 has sent a rating request to the visitor.\nRating submitted successfully.

For the roles to only monitor his own department's chats, enable Monitor My Departments' Chats only.\n[2024/05/13 11:26:14]:Lucas - Comm100:It seems you want to grant permission to a few agents with that role?\n[2024/05/13 11:26:55]:Devran :The forwarding rules for the two campaigns are the same. Only two teams have different captains. I don't want any special guidance. So a team captain should only be able to follow her own team's conversations.\n[2024/05/13 11:28:00]:Devran :I separated the teams. And I want to give one of the people on that team the authority to monitor their own department. Why should I set routing rules for this?\n[2024/05/13 11:28:25]:Lucas - Comm100:Canl\u0131 Destek team and RMT Canl\u0131 Destek team, correct?\n[2024/05/13 11:28:37]:Devran :YEs\n[2024/05/13 11:30:07]:Lucas - Comm100:You have to enable routing rules. I explained this earlier. Monitor My Departments' Chats permission, it works only when a chat has department info.\n[2024/05/13 11:30:39]:Lucas - Comm100:when routing rules is disabled, this chat has no department info. The agents with \"\"Monitor My Departments' Chats\"\" permission can not monitor the chats from his department.\n[2024/05/13 11:33:06]:Lucas - Comm100:Hope this clarifies\n[2024/05/13 11:33:45]:Devran :I understand this at home. But why does this exist? I have already separated the teams. I should be able to view my own team without routing rules, right?\n\n[2024/05/13 11:34:24]:Lucas - Comm100:You have not built the association between chats and departments. Routing rules does THIS.\n[2024/05/13 11:34:55]:Devran :When I activate routing rules. Will members who connect to live support make any choices? \n[2024/05/13 11:36:31]:Lucas - Comm100:No, if you want the members to select the department themselves, enable Department on Pre-Chat page\nAgent Lucas - Comm100 has sent a file: 2024-05-13T03-36-42-583Z.png\n[2024/05/13 11:36:54]:Devran :Okay \n[2024/05/13 11:37:18]:Devran :Why can I only select one department in this section?\n\nThe visitor has sent a file: image.png\n[2024/05/13 11:37:43]:Devran :Is choosing a department enough for me to just follow it?\n\n[2024/05/13 11:38:06]:Devran :I think it won't cause any problems in other departments.\n\n[2024/05/13 11:38:30]:Lucas - Comm100:What's your requirements? Specify please\n[2024/05/13 11:39:51]:Lucas - Comm100:when to route chats to Canl\u0131 Destek\n[2024/05/13 11:40:04]:Lucas - Comm100:when to route chats to RMT Canl\u0131 Destek\n[2024/05/13 11:40:58]:Devran :The problem is that I don't have a requirement. When my clients connect, they can randomly connect to one of two departments. Shouldn't choose. And I should only be able to watch my own team's chats.\n[2024/05/13 11:41:47]:Devran :There will be no special guidance. Each member connected will randomly fall into one of the two teams.\n[2024/05/13 11:42:02]:Lucas - Comm100:You are wrong. You need to tell the system when to route chats to Canl\u0131 Destek, when to route chats to RMT Canl\u0131 Destek\n[2024/05/13 11:42:26]:Lucas - Comm100:otherwise enable Department on Pre-Chat page\n[2024/05/13 11:42:38]:Lucas - Comm100:let the customers select it\n[2024/05/13 11:44:10]:Lucas - Comm100:It's required.\n[2024/05/13 11:46:33]:Devran :And you are wrong too. Because you don't understand this. I have employees who do the same job. And when I want to follow the conversation, all the conversations appear at once. But I want this. Dividing these people into teams and assigning a team captain to each of them. Because, instead of monitoring the chats of 20 people, it will be easier for 1 person to control the chats of only 4 people by making 4 people captain. And since they're doing the same job, I don't have to give my customers a choice.\n\n[2024/05/13 11:47:31]:Devran :You designed the program for the satisfaction of the customers. However, you have not made it easier to track your own customers. Sorry, but Live Chat is better in this regard\n\n[2024/05/13 11:49:21]:Lucas - Comm100:I am reading your words\n[2024/05/13 11:49:25]:Lucas - Comm100:Hold on\n[2024/05/13 11:49:41]:Devran :Thank you for your interest.

Because if the problem is not solved, I will ask my bosses to agree with a different application. This is important for me. Because following people by dividing them into parts rather than following many people provides better quality conversations.\n[2024/05/13 11:58:44]:Devran :Thank you so much Lucas \ud83d\ude4f\n[2024/05/13 11:59:06]:Lucas - Comm100:No worries.
