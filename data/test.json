They can view history prior to today, but not any chat history from today. I was just wanting to check in and see if there might be something going on. \n[2022/04/20 21:37:37]:Lucas - Comm100:Hello Tessa\n[2022/04/20 21:37:47]:Lucas - Comm100:Thanks for contacting Comm100\n[2022/04/20 21:37:58]:Lucas - Comm100:Please give me a few minutes to check.

Could you let me know?\n[2022/04/20 21:44:06]:Tessa (Coach):I am not currently chatting, but I our agents have been actively chatting since 9:00 am EST and there is no chat history for any of them individually, and I cannot see any history for any of them as an admin. \n[2022/04/20 21:44:24]:Tessa (Coach):I can ask our team whoever last closed a chat though if needed. \n[2022/04/20 21:45:14]:Lucas - Comm100:Sure. Meanwhile I am trying to make a call to tech team to investigate\n[2022/04/20 21:46:20]:Tessa (Coach):Sure thing! Let me double check and see if I can get a time from someone. Without the history, it's a little hard to know the exact time a chat has ended. \n[2022/04/20 21:47:10]:Lucas - Comm100:Take your time. If you can not manage to get it, no problem\n[2022/04/20 21:48:32]:Tessa (Coach):Looks like our last chat was ended by our agent Kayla at 9:47 am EST\n[2022/04/20 21:49:22]:Lucas - Comm100:Thanks for letting me know\n[2022/04/20 21:49:45]:Lucas - Comm100:I will get back to you shortly. Please stay with me for a while\n[2022/04/20 21:50:46]:Tessa (Coach):Sounds good, thank you! I am not sure if it is relevant, but a few of our agents did have Windows updates over the weekend. I am not sure if you guys have had other companies reach out about delays in history and it being related to Windows updates, but I figured it might be worth mentioning. I will hang tight here though! \n[2022/04/20 21:52:54]:Tessa (Coach):I did just double check, and it seems that the agents that did not have Windows updates are also unable to pull history, so that might not be related. \n[2022/04/20 21:53:52]:Lucas - Comm100:Thanks! I just got an update from tech team. It appears an issue on our side. Apologies for the inconvenience. Tech team is now on a bridge to get it resolved.
